## Project Description
We were provided the data sources in the project file. They include excel files. The task is to explore and clean the data in order to remove any outliers and missing values. This involves exploring the data using histograms, scatter plots and heat maps. After renaming columns and cleaning the data, I again displayed histograms and scatter plots to verify that the data was properly cleaned. Finally, I created a linear regression model object and performed a simple linear regression.
